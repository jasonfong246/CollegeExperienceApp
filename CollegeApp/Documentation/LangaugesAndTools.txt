We used react native to make the Android app and SQLite to handle any backend development: storing name, gender, etc.
 In the repository we split each part of the introduction section into multiple folders. 
 So each choice had its own folder dedicated to it and comprised of default React Native required files, images and a TSX file. 
 The TSX is where most of the action happens. In it you’ll see us break it down into the imports, React Native compatibility code, and so scripts and styling. 
Check the TSX file for more information.


Installing Features:

You’ll need Visual Studio Code, React Native, NodeJS, and Android Studio
For this we followed this guide
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native

And add this line to the terminal when you’re done installing:
npm install react-native-sound --save

We tried adding sound but never had the time to complete it.
