A user makes a game and then creates a character with a name, gender, and character image based on gender. However we did not implement the player name 
and image to the game. As the player moves on they make choices that will take them to different screens. 

Ideas We Had:
Essentially have it set day by day and have the player start in the dorm and have choices on what to do: class, party, etc. but have the player 
end up in a dorm or a place to continue to the next day.
